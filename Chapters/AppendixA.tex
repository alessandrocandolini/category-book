\chapter{Rudiments of axiomatic set theory}

To ensure these notes are as self-contained as possible, this appendix provides an overview of fundamental results in standard axiomatic set theory (\ie, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice). It also covers the set-theoretic construction of basic algebraic structures such as monoids and groups.
